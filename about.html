			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Krishna Shahu, I'm 21 years old and I'm a native Indian. I have several years of experience coding Front-End and Back-End using different languages, such as HTML/CSS, C#, C++ and JavaScript. I gathered interest in programming when I began high school. I was on the Computer Science track, which meant I was taking programming courses daily through the period I was enrolled. During the two years I was a high school student, I've learned App Development for Andriod, C# and Java, documenting my weekly assignments each semester on Google Sites. I wasn't sure what I could do with a career with Computer Science at the time, but I knew I was excited to see something I created in real time. I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies. I was encouraged to seek out Hackathons during my Junior year by my Java teacher. From there on, I knew I wanted to pursue Computer Programming professionally.
			<br><br>I'm currently attending HKBK College of Engineering, obtaining an Bachelor's degree in CSE. Aftering graduation,  I'm actively involved in a number of extracurricular activities, such as Technology club, Hackathons. Hopefully, in the next couple of years, I'll be in an Dev role where I'm passionate about my projects and using my platform to inspire young talents.</p>
